# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
I created a daily planner that will allow the user to manage their time effectively with their busy schedule. The time blocks in the scheduler is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future based on the current time. When you enter an event and click the save button for that time block, the event will be saved in the local storage and will persist on the page.
